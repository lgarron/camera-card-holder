- Increase the vertical height of the plunger front.

## v0.4.19

- Adjust the lever calculations so they also work for SD card sizes.

## v0.4.18

- `compose()` all blocks instead of duplicating code for carveouts.

## v0.4.17

## v0.4.15

- Fix the axle hole and plunger chute carving forrealz.
- Decrease the plunger wall clearance for the head.
- Decrease the back spring compression to an even further negative value.
- Increase the number of slots to 3 for testing.

## v0.4.14

- Increase `EJECTOR_PLUNGER_WALL_CLEARANCE` to 0.2.

## v0.4.13

- Ensure the axle holes and plunger chutes are properly carved from adjacent stacked casings.

## v0.4.12

- Implement stacking.
- Set the design to 4 slots.

## v0.4.11

## v0.4.6

- Change the spring compression to be lighter.

## v0.4.5

- Use two half-sized springs on each side instead of a single one.
- Carve space for the card tab to enable the card to sit flush in front.

## v0.4.4

- Fix the plunger front button width.

## v0.4.3

- Remove one of the axle snap connectors.
- Change the lever to be thicker throughout more of its length.

- Adjust how close ejector plunger and lever distance are at printing time.
- Thicken the lever around the axle.
- Add lever printing supports.

## v0.4.1

front surface that can be turned into a button.
  - Increase ejector plunger depth to compensate.
- Add a bigger ejector button.
- Add snappable axle supports for printing.

## v0.4.0

- Refactor into the `compose(â€¦)` paradigm.
